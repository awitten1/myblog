In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the debate between dynamic and static typing continues to be a hot topic. While dynamic typing offers flexibility and rapid development, static typing brings its own set of powerful advantages that can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of code. In this post, we'll explore why static typing is crucial for developers, accompanied by practical examples through markdown code snippets.

## Improved Code Quality and Safety

One of the most compelling reasons to use static typing is the improvement it brings to code quality and safety. By enforcing type checks at compile time, static typing catches errors early in the development process, reducing the chances of runtime errors.

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```
